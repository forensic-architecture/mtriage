desc: A special-case analyser that gets under mtriage's skin to allow you to string multiple analysers into one.
args:
  - name: dev
    desc: Run a meta analyser in DEV mode.
    required: False
    input: bool
  - name: delete_cache
    desc: If set to true, the intermediary media that are generated in the process of running different analysers in serial will be retained. If set to false, only the final media will be kept, and the rest will be deleted.
    required: True
    input: bool
  - name: children
    desc: An array of objects that have both a 'name', the string that indicates which analyser should be used, and a nested 'config' object which represents the config options that should be passed to each analyser in the chain. The 'elements_in' attribute is inferred for each analyser from the output of the analyser that comes before it, and thus this option cannot be specified. Other analyser-specific options, however, should be specified here.
    required: true
    input: array
