# Contributing to mtriage

Welcome and thanks for your interest!

The easiest way to get involved in the Forensic Architecture OSS community is to [join the discussion on Discord](https://discord.gg/FJ4XsCg). If you're having trouble getting up and running with any of our codebases, please don't hesitate to ask questions on the #support channel.

### Releases
We are developing mtriage on an approximate 2-week-long release cycle. Issues being tackled in the current release usually have a 'release' tag, and are normally listed in the [Release project board](https://github.com/forensic-architecture/mtriage/projects/1).

You can learn about what we are currently working on by looking at the latest
update. [Updates can be found here](docs/updates).

### Help Wanted
The best issues to get started on are those with a 'help wanted' tag. Unless they are already assigned, these are generally issues that are sufficiently removed from our core development cycle, and are typically good for community contributors. Issues with an additional 'good first issue' tag don't require a much knowledge of mtriage's internals specifically, and so are ideal for new contributors.

### Tests and Formatting
All python code is formatted with the [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) formatter. (CI builds will fail if code is not Black-formatted.)

Tests coverage is not complete, but they can be run with the following:
```python
python run.py test
```

Please note that mtriage is still in a very early stage of development, but we will keep updating this document as the code changes.

Thanks again for your interest and for your future contributions!
