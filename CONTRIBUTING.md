# Contributing to mtriage

Welcome and thanks for your interest!

The easiest way to get involved in the Forensic Architecture OSS community is
to [join the discussion on Discord](https://discord.gg/FJ4XsCg). If you're
having trouble getting up and running with any of our codebases, please don't
hesitate to ask questions on the #support channel.

### Releases We are developing mtriage on an approximate 2-week-long release
cycle. Issues being tackled in the current release usually have a 'release'
tag, and are normally listed in the [Release project
board](https://github.com/forensic-architecture/mtriage/projects/1).

You can learn about what we are currently working on by looking at the latest
update. [Updates can be found here](docs/updates).

### Help Wanted The best issues to get started on are those with a 'help
wanted' tag. Unless they are already assigned, these are generally issues that
are sufficiently removed from our core development cycle, and are typically
good for community contributors. Issues with an additional 'good first issue'
tag don't require a much knowledge of mtriage's internals specifically, and so
are ideal for new contributors.

### Tests and Formatting All python code is formatted with the
[black](https://github.com/ambv/black) formatter. (CI builds will fail if code
is not Black-formatted.)

Tests coverage is not complete, but they can be run with the following:
```
python ./mtriage dev test
```
## New components
If you are contributing a new component (i.e. an analyser or a selector),
ensure that your component lists the correct dependencies. You can do so by
ensuring that it works in a [standalone custom build](./docs/custom-builds.md).
